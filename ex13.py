# to run this program, we need to provide four arguments to python3.7 calling

#Mistake #3

# we have to pass exact number of argument to unpack the argv (argument variable), less or more will throw error.

"""
Whatâ€™s the difference between argv and input()? The difference has to do with where the user is required to give input.
If they give your script inputs on the command line, then you use argv.
If you want them to input using the keyboard while the script is running, then use input()."""
