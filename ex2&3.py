# printing a string which needs to be enclosed in ""
print("I will count my shoes now")

# printing string along with mathematical operation, Python follows PEMDAS rule for mathematical calculation
# Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.),Multiplication and Division (left-to-right),addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

# So, 20/10*10-10/5*2 => 2*10-2*2 => 20-4 => 16 (means first divide, then multiplication, and then rest)

# Some mathematical operations such as sum, substract, multiplication, division, modulus

#an example of addition or sum
print("What is sum of 2 and 3 ?")
print("Answer is ",2+3)

#an example of substract or minus
print(" What is difference of 5 and 2.3 ?")
print("Answer : ",5-2.3)
# to add a blank line between paragraphs, or code, use "/n"
print("\n")

#an example of division or divide
print("What if we divide 20 and 5? ")
print ("Ok, Answer is ",20/5)
# to add a blank line between paragraphs, or code, use "/n"
print("\n")

#an example of multiplication
print("Alexa, what's the product of 18 and 9 ?")

#Now check Boolean output for mathematical operation such as true or false
print("Is it true 3+2 <5-7?")

# below statement will only print Boolean output, either true or false. if condition is right, then true else false
print(3+2<5-7)
print("What is 3+2?", 3+2)
print("What is 5-7?", 5-7)

#Some more operations for comparison or condition
print("Is 5 greator then -2? ", 5>-2)
print("Is 5 greator then or equal to -2?", 5>=-2)
print("Is 5 less or equal to -2?",5<=-2)

#modulus
print("What's the mode of 11 and 5?", 11%5)
print("if it's 0 then first number is even else it's odd")
